                    Hello! My name is Kaylin Chin and I'm from Farmington Hills, Michigan! I am currently a student at Michigan State University studying Information Science with a focus in Media and Information

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <P>
                    The reason I chose to study at MSU was because when I was 3 years old, I decided I wanted to be an equine veteranarian! However as I got older I realized that I was not cut out to be a good docotor, so I chose to study in a similar field as my Dad! I've been working and playing with PC's and other technology since I was wound 9 years old, and I'm usally the person my friends go to when they need technology help! I'm hoping to go into the cybersecuirty field, and I'm currently loving the MI classes and meeting other InfoSci majors!
