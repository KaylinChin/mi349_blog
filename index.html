            <p>On September 23, after over a year of actively searching I was finally able to find and purchase a Monstera! This is a Monstera Deliciosa, which is a tropical plant native to the tropical forests of southern Mexico. These plants are known for their beautiful large split leaves and rare variegated varieties. I was able to bring this plant home from a nursery called Lansing Gardens, and I was even able to get a student discount! I started my gardening journey with a pothos plant that miraculously survived the cold winter in a dorm room! I love getting house plants while living in a dorm because I don’t have to worry about them being pet-safe! I have a very nosy dog, who also loves to eat things he is not supposed to be eating. I love watching my plants grow and flourish with care and attention! I love to see the start of new leaves that have yet to unfurl! Plants can be a very rewarding experience as long as you take care of them properly, and be sure to do the proper amount of research before purchasing a new plant! Always remember to not over or under water, and keep an eye on the temperature!

            <h4>Blog Entry - Kitties</h4>
            <time datetime="2024-07-23" title="July 23, 2024">Jul 23, 2024</time>

            <p>These are my two kitties getting along together and looking out the window at the birds that made their home in that giant shrub. Scrunky, left, is a two year old diluted tortoiseshell cat that I rescued. She recently got a sister, Billie, who is on the right and she's a 2.5 month old tortoiseshell! They both play together and fight over treats! They love sitting on the patio, sunbathing, and taking mid-day naps! These two kitties live at my mom’s house while I’m away at college, and she takes good care of them! I love visiting them when I’m home, but I am sadly quite allergic to cats. I still play with them, give them cuddles and kisses even though I pay for it in the long run. Billie loves to sit on my lap while I work on my laptop, while Scrunkly prefers to watch from afar. Sometimes if you give Scrunkly a treat prior to trying to pet her she’s much more of a fan of pets and being held! Both of these cats have huge personalities and never fail to make me and my family laugh at them, especially when they have the zoomies or get hyper!
